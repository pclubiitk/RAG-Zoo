# Query Transformer

In case of RAG techniques having good queries can make our results MUCH BETTER. 
Query transformation rewrites or reformulates the userâ€™s query to improve retrieval accuracy and relevance
That's exactly what the [query_transformer](../Module-By-Module%20Deep%20Dive/query_transformer.md) module does

```python title="Query Transformation" linenums="1"
from rag_src.query_transformer import LLMWebQueryTransformer
from rag_src.llm import OpenAILLM

llm = OpenAILLM()

web_transformer = LLMWebQueryTransformer(llm = llm)
web_search_query = web_transformer.transform("What were the latest advancements in AI in 2024?")
print("\nWeb Search Optimized Query - ")
print(web_search_query[0])
```
