# Advanced RAG Techniques

When we have normal RAG techniques, why use Advanced RAGs? The features of Advanced RAG techniques include (but are not limited to):

- Better Chunking based on the Question
- Multi Hop Reasoning
- More Relevant
- Self Verification

  Hence, the ability to incorporate advanced rag techniques in programs with minimal lines of code is amazing isn't it?
  We can do that with the modules from [Advanced RAG Pipelines](../Module-By-Module%20Deep%20Dive/Complete_RAG_Pipeline.md)
