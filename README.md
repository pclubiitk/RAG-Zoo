## Overview

RAG-Zoo is a highly modular Python framework created to simplify the development, experimentation, and deployment of diverse Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines. 

Its plugin-based architecture, dependency injection, and comprehensive registry system enable developers to plug in custom or third-party modules seamlessly

Combined with thorough testing suites, CI/CD support, and an easy-to-launch demo app, RAG-Zoo is built to accelerate both research prototypes and real-world RAG applications
